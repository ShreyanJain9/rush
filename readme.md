imagine ruby but unpleasant


use using thing.rb.


This is the perfect programming language. Functions are defined like so:

```ruby
ƒ :say_hi, -> {
    puts "hi"
  }
```
There are some predefined Math functions for you. For example, you can use ∑ to collect the sum of all its arguments!! or π for the constant Pi.

You can also work with Lisp-style Linked Lists (Conses of Conses all the way down)

The literal form for these is usually something like:

```ruby

´(:why, :am, :i, :using, :this) #=> (:why (:am (:i (:using (:this nil)))))

# same thing:

´(*(%i(why am i using this)))

```
